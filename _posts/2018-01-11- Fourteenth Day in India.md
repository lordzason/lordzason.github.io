## 01/11/2018 Fourteenth Day
### First Day in Kochi

For breakfast, I tried an ayruvedic drink, boiled water with cinnamon.
Ashams, our guide from Costford with us in Kochi, was drinking it and I requested the same thing.
It smells and tastes like boiled water, but it has a dark pink color to it.
The other new thing I tried in the morning was boiled plantains. 
The texture was mushy and it had no plantain taste.

After the agreeable breakfast, Jaigopal Rao from the Inspiration introduced the architectural firm and some of their projects.
There were several interesting main points for me.
First, Inspiration tries to redefine the concept of luxury from the conventional, opulent materials, like granite or marble, to the attention of more earthly materials like concrete, exposed brick, or terracotta. 
I agree with their approach because I am a supporter of a similar movement, the revitalization of traditional Cantonese architecture with gray bricks.
Second, sustainable architectural techniques, such as using thatched roofs, revives traditional arts and culture and also provides continual employment.
While these points are valid, the sustained replacement of the roofing material may be trouble for owners.
I see this unique technique difficult to promote in light of other materials on the market.
However, materials such as bamboo, I predict would exert its presence in the future construction materials industry. 
Now I just need to find a good bamboo grower and processor to invest in.
Third, sustainability can bring about new businesses.
For example, the hotel Sarovaram, designed by Inspiration, offers capsule rooms.
These small rooms are not attractive to others, but I enjoy the comfort of the small space and living with the bare essentials.
Furthermore, such small rooms provide cost-savings in terms of construction and energy consumption, which should be transferred back to the consumer through lower rental rates.
This, theoretically, should make travel and very decent accommodations available to a wider range of people, particularly students and those with low incomes.

The next presentation was from G. P. Hari, the Additional General Manager of the Kochi Metro Rail.
Kochi recently opened a new metro line in the past six months, joining a few of the Indian cities that have metro lines.
The proposed system for the new metro line plans to integrate institutional, physical, information, and fare systems under the new Kochi Metropolitan Authority.
One of its main selling points is that it is the "first time" that an integrated transportation solution in India has been adopted.
The plan is to have Kochi residents be able to access public transportation within 500 meters of them.
An example of their goal is to have an elderly person schedule a ride on auto-rickshaw, which would drop him off at either a bus or metro station and from there seamless transfers to other types of transfers and connections, such as to the water-taxis.
I think the main ingenuous approach was to partner with Axis Bank, which provided the funding for the project and also royalties to the KMA. *(Finding these public-private partnerships is perhaps the new dominant approach in transportation planning and in planning generally)*
Another interesting point to note is that some analysis of the data collected from the Metro would be sent to a local university for students to conduct data analysis, partially as part of their education and partly as a service.
I support these partnerships that utilize the unique positions of universities as the centers of research but also centers of human and social capital.
The final point that interested me was the proposal for telescopic payment.
Those who travel further would pay less. 
I am not sure of the economics behind this scheme, but I think more intensive land use planning should avoid further developments of people commuting in the first place.

A fantastic lunch at the Grand Hotel in Kochi where I ordered Vendakka Mappas. 
One of the best dishes I ordered during the trip.

Strolling into Maharajas College station for a metro ride to Aluva and back.
The new metro was very comfortable and smooth riding. 
I was surprised there was not more people, though there were a lot of school children and students.
I think the best way to educate the public in shaping their future patterns is through schooling and education.
Take a child to a metro and he or she will learn how to use and ride it and then teach others.

Attended a Kalaripayattu, Keralan martial arts, demonstrate in the evening.
Jerry was right when he warned us about sitting in the front row, which I did.
There were literally sparks flying from the strength of the blades hitting one another.
Adding onto the famous deeds of Bodi Dharma, bringing martial arts to China as well as Buddhism.
